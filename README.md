# Image Steganography App ðŸ‘€

## Description

Image Steganography is the art of hiding text data within images such that it is invisible to the human eye. This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Python's Tkinter library, enabling users to:

* Import images
* Embed secret messages using Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography
* Extract hidden messages from stego-images
* Save the resulting image after embedding a message

The goal of this application is to allow secure, user-friendly, and practical message hiding for privacy-conscious users.

## How to Use

1. **Run the App**

```bash
python MAIN.py
```

2. **Import Image**

* Click on "Import Image"
* Choose a PNG or JPG image from your system

3. **Embed Text**

* Type your secret message in the provided text box
* Click on "Hide message & save image"
* Save the modified image when prompted

4. **Extract Text**

* Import a stego-image (an image that contains hidden text)
* Click on "Show hidden message" to reveal the secret message

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x** - Core language for development
* **Tkinter** - For GUI components
* **Pillow (PIL)** - To manipulate and edit images
* **LSB Steganography Algorithm** - To hide data within image pixels

## Challenges & Future Work

### Challenges

* Ensuring that large texts donâ€™t overflow the image capacity
* Proper error handling during embedding and extraction
* Maintaining image quality after embedding

### Future Enhancements

* Add support for audio/video steganography
* Implement drag-and-drop image upload
* Encrypt messages before embedding for double security
* Add format compatibility checks
